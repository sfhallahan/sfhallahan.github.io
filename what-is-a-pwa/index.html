            Last week I was lucky enough to receive the "Grow with Google" scholarship
            for the Mobile Web track. The scholarship covers tuition for a Udacity
            course developed by Google called <a class="hyperlink" href="https://www.udacity.com/course/offline-web-applications--ud899">"Offline Web Applications"</a>,
            access to a private a support forum and dedicated course mentors to provide
            guidance and feedback. I honestly wasn’t sure what the course was going to
            cover, or why offline first would be useful, but it was made by Google
            and they usually know what they’re doing when it comes to the web.
          </p>
          <p>
            I ventured off into the course. The intro lessons showed how designing
            a web application to be offline first fit into the concept of "Progressive
            Web Applications" (PWA’s). I had heard the term PWA thrown around in my
            internet travels but never really paid them much mind until these lessons.
            I’m going to assume you are naive, much like I was at the beginning of my
            journey (3 days ago) and guide you through makes a web app "Progressive."
          </p>
          <h3 class="sub-header">What is a PWA?</h3>
          <p>
            A Progressive Web App (PWA) is a web application that attempts to
            deliver the native mobile experience that users have come to expect
            from App/Play store applications. To me, this means when you access
            the app on your phone, you look around and think:
          </p>
          <blockquote class="quote">
            "Hmmm, I don’t feel like I'm in a browser, but I sure don’t remember
            downloading this from the App Store."
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            So what’s the gap between a traditional web app and something you
            would see from a native app? And how does a PWA fill that gap?
          </p>
          <h5 class="section-header">Accessible from the Homescreen</h5>
          <p>
            To access a web app, you open up Chrome
            (or whatever browser you use), click the address bar, type in the url
            then hit enter. You wait for the page to load, and finally you get something.
            With a native app it's just click the app icon on the homescreen and BOOM
            splash screen.
          </p>
          <figure class="img-small-width">
            <img src="/img/fb_splashscreen.png" alt="Facebook splash screen" />
            <figcaption class="img-caption">
              Facebook splash screen
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            We need an icon and splash screen. A PWA gets this done by including
            a Web App Manifest file. In the manifest there are details on the icon,
            app name, and colors/themes for the splash screen. When using the app
            for the first time, users get a prompt to add a homescreen shortcut and
            volia, a nice little app icon on the homescreen and a splash screen while
            the app loads.
          </p>
          <p>
            Alright, that wasn't so bad, what's next?
          </p>
          <h5 class="section-header">Works Offline</h5>
          <p>
            Put your phone in airplane mode, or go get lost in the woods. Now go
            into the mobile browser and open up facebook.com, what do you see?
            Probably an error.
          <p>
            Okay, now open up the facebook app on your phone. You get the navigation bar,
            maybe some old posts and a message that you are offline. You can't do
            much but you're not completely crippled. This is gap number 2. PWA's
            must be designed and built to work offline first.
          </p>
          <div class="side-by-side">
            <figure>
              <img src="/img/offline_webapp.png" alt="offline web application error screen" />
              <figcaption class="img-caption">
                Offline web app
              </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <figure>
              <img src="/img/offline_mobileapp.png" alt="offile mobile application screen that still displays app skeleton" />
              <figcaption class="img-caption">
                Offline mobile app

            </figure>
          </div>
          <p>
            PWA's achieve this by using what's called a "Service Worker". At its
            core the Service worker is just a javascript file that operates separate
            from the webpage. Operating outside the webpage opens up a lot of possibilities,
            but the feature that allows it to solve the offline first problem is the
            ability to intercept network requests.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the apps initial load a service worker can create a cache and store
            critical assets. It can then intercept future network requests and serve
            the cached content before attempting to retrieve resources from the network.
            No service? No problem. You can serve the skeleton of your app, recently
            accessed pages, whatever's in the cache before even trying to hit the network.
            Users now get something, rather than that pesky 404 or "no internet connection" page.
          </p>
          <h5 class="section-header">Responsive</h5>
          <p>
            This one is a bit obvious, but maybe the most important. Web
            applications are often access by multiple screen sizes, where-as native
            apps are built exclusively for mobile. If you want to give a truly
            native experience, your app needs to respond appropriately to the screen
            that it's on and deliver a mobile first experience. New CSS technologies
            like flexbox and CSS grid are making building responsive web apps easier than ever.
          </p>
          <h5 class="section-header">Access to device hardware</h5>
          <p>
            Ability to access the device hardware is a gap between native apps and
            PWA's that is still closing. Fret not, it is closing fast. Service
            workers have opened up access to native features like push notifications.
            It won't be long before PWA's can cover 99% of use cases for an app.
          </p>
          <h5 class="section-header">Secure (served over https)</h5>
          <p>
            The world is a mean place. There are bad people out there that want to
            steal your stuff and hurt your phone. Mobile apps must be screened by
            Apple and Google to the App/Play store. A PWA comes straight from the
            internet so there are the usual
            dangers that come with web browsing. Additionally, PWA's use a service
            worker which we mentioned can manipulate requests and access some on the
            hardware on the device. If someone hijacks your service worker, they can
            do a lot of damage.  For this reason, in order to even use a service worker
            your content must be served over https.
          </p>
          <h5 class="sub-header">But wait, there's more</h5>
          <p>
            These are the largest pieces of the progressive web app puzzle. Google
            is leading the charge on progressive web apps and has put out a
            comprehensive checklist for developers to work against when building
            a PWA. That list can be found
            <a class="hyperlink" href="https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/checklist#baseline">here</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you want to learn more about progressive web apps, I definitely
            recommend checking out the Google resources on the topic. Also, keep
            an eye out for some additional posts from me as I work through my course.
            Some topics I plan to dive into are the mystery of the Service Worker
            and sending native push notifications from a web app.
          </p>
          <p>
            Happy coding!
