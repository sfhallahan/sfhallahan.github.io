# Personal Website - seanhallahan.com

This is my personal website. It contains a little information about myself, a blog with technical topics I find interesting/noteworthy, and a portfolio of my projects (which is honestly just a collection of links to my github).

It's a simple static site built with HTML, CSS and Javascript. As you may have guessed by the name of the repo, I've used github pages to host it (and I have to say, the ease of use is just delightful). I also used CloudFlare for SSL.

The site is live and can be viewed at https://seanhallahan.com
